## What is Screenly?

Screenly is a desktop app for recording and editing screen captures with motion-driven presentation tools built in. Instead of sending raw footage to a motion designer just to add zooms, cursor polish, or a styled background, Screenly handles that workflow in one place for free — plus on-device AI (transcription, translation, and neural voiceover) that never leaves your machine.

Screenly runs on:

- **macOS** 14.0+
- **Windows** 10 Build 19041+
- **Linux** on modern distros

Platform notes:

- **macOS** uses native ScreenCaptureKit-based capture helpers.
- **Windows** uses a native Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) helper on supported builds, with native WASAPI audio support.
- **Linux** records through Electron capture APIs. Cursor hiding is not supported on Linux today.

# Core Features

## Auto-zooms, cursor polish, and styled frames
Screenly can automatically emphasize activity with zoom suggestions, smooth cursor movement, add motion effects, and place the final composition inside a styled frame with wallpapers, colors, gradients, blur, padding, and shadows.

</p>

## Dynamic webcam bubble overlays
Add webcam footage as an overlay bubble, position it with presets or custom coordinates, mirror it, control shadow and roundness, and optionally make it react to zoom so it stays visually balanced during motion.

## Timeline editing built for demos
Use drag-and-drop timeline tools for zooms, trims, speed regions, annotations, extra audio regions, and crop-aware edits. Save and reopen work as `.screenly` project files.

</p>

## On-device AI: transcription, translation, and voiceover
Screenly ships with local AI models (Whisper for transcription, Gemma for translation, and Kokoro for neural voiceover) that run entirely on-device — no footage or audio ever leaves your machine. Models download once and run offline after that; a built-in native-speech fallback is always available.

## Extensions & Marketplace

Screenly has a community-driven extension system. Anyone can build and publish extensions that add new capabilities to Screenly — cursor click sounds, device frames, browser mockups, wallpapers, render hooks, settings panels, and more.

# Installation

## Quick install (one command)

**macOS** — downloads the correct build for your Mac's chip and installs to `/Applications`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamadarsha/screenly/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows** (PowerShell) — downloads and launches the installer:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamadarsha/screenly/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

> [!NOTE]
> Screenly builds are not yet signed with an Apple Developer ID / notarization or a Windows code-signing certificate. On macOS the quick-install script avoids the Gatekeeper warning (see below); on Windows, SmartScreen will prompt once — choose "More info" → "Run anyway".

## Download a build manually

Prebuilt releases are available at:

https://github.com/iamadarsha/screenly/releases

---

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

**macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxrandr-dev libxt-dev
```

**Windows:** Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools) with the C++ workload and CMake.

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamadarsha/screenly.git screenly
cd screenly
npm install
npm run dev
```

For packaged builds:

```bash
npm run build
```

Target-specific build commands are also available:

- `npm run build:mac`
- `npm run build:win`
- `npm run build:linux`

---

## macOS: "App cannot be opened"

This only affects builds you download from a browser or build yourself locally (the quick-install script above avoids it, since files downloaded with `curl` aren't quarantined by macOS). macOS may still quarantine a browser-downloaded or locally built app.

Remove the quarantine flag with:

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Screenly.app
```

# System Requirements

| Platform | Minimum version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) | Required for ScreenCaptureKit audio and microphone capture. |
| **Windows** | Windows 10 20H1 (Build 19041, May 2020) | Required for the native Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) helper and best cursor-hiding behavior. |
| **Linux** | Any modern distro | Recording works through Electron capture. System audio generally requires PipeWire. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Windows builds older than 19041, recording can still work through fallback capture, but the real OS cursor may remain visible in recordings.

---

# Usage

## Record

1. Launch Screenly.
2. Select a screen or window.
3. Choose microphone and system-audio options.
4. Start recording.
5. Stop recording to open the editor.

## Edit

Inside the editor you can:

- add trims, zooms, speed regions, and annotations
- tune cursor behavior and preview volume
- style the frame with wallpapers, colors, gradients, blur, padding, and corners
- add or adjust webcam overlay footage
- add extra audio regions
- crop the frame and choose an aspect ratio
- generate captions, translate them, or add an AI voiceover — all processed locally on-device

Save your work anytime as a `.screenly` project.

## Export

Export options include:

- **MP4** for standard video output
- **GIF** for lightweight sharing and loops

You can adjust format-specific settings such as quality, GIF frame rate, GIF looping, and output size before export.

# Limitations

### Cursor capture

Screenly renders a polished cursor overlay on top of the recording. Platform cursor-hiding behavior still depends on OS support.

**macOS**
- ScreenCaptureKit can exclude the real cursor cleanly.

**Windows**
- Best results require Windows 10 Build 19041+ and the native capture helper.
- Older builds fall back to Electron capture, so the real cursor may remain visible.

**Linux**
- Electron desktop capture does not currently support cursor hiding.
- If you also enable the rendered cursor overlay, exports may show both the real cursor and the styled cursor.

### System audio

System audio support varies by platform.

**Windows**
- Native WASAPI support

**Linux**
- Usually requires PipeWire

**macOS**
- Requires macOS 14.0+ and the ScreenCaptureKit-based workflow

---

# How It Works

Screenly combines a platform-specific capture layer with a renderer-driven editor and export pipeline.

**Capture**
- Electron coordinates recording and application flow
- macOS uses native ScreenCaptureKit helpers
- Windows uses a native Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) helper and native audio helpers where available

**Editing**
- Timeline regions define zooms, trims, speed changes, audio overlays, and annotations
- Cursor and webcam styling are applied in the editor state

**Rendering**
- Scene composition is handled by **PixiJS**

**Export**
- The same scene logic used in preview is rendered into exported MP4 or GIF output

**AI**
- Transcription (Whisper), translation (Gemma), and voiceover (Kokoro) all run as local ONNX models on-device; nothing is uploaded

**Projects**
- `.screenly` files store the source media path plus editor state so work can be reopened later (legacy `.recordly` / `.openscreen` files remain openable)

## Acknowledgements

Screenly is a rebranded fork of Recordly, which itself originally started as a fork of [OpenScreen](https://github.com/siddharthvaddem/openscreen). Over 80% of code has diverged from OpenScreen since. Many features such as its zoom animations trace back to early versions of Recordly.
